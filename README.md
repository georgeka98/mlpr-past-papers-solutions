# Past Papers Unofficial Solutions

While studying and unable to have the solutions for these papers, I 
decided to create this document which will contain all (unofficial) 
solutions from every question from every past paper in the MLPR course. 
There are only a few days till the exam, so I won’t be writing answers in 
details; rather a sentence or a phrase to which you can use to expand your 
solution for that question.

These answers have been written by me or with some assistance from someone 
who knew the topic or material more than I do. Some questions contain 
multiple possible answers. It’s important to note that these answers are 
not official and not fact-checked with a course organizer. Take them with 
a grain of salt.

If you have any suggestion or any edits I should make, please email me, 
and I will immediately act on it.
